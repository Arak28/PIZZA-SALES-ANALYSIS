# PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW-
This project presents an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data using SQL for querying and Microsoft Excel for dashboard creation. SQL was used to extract business-critical KPIs such as total revenue, orders, quantity sold, and product performance. Post-query data cleaning and transformation were performed in Excel, followed by building an interactive dashboard using pivot tables, slicers, and charts to visualize the trends and business insights.

## OBJECTIVE-
The objective was to derive valuable business insights from raw transactional sales data by:

1. Analyzing daily, hourly, and monthly trends in pizza orders

2. Calculating key performance indicators like total revenue, average order value, and average pizzas per order

3. Evaluating sales distribution across pizza sizes and categories

4. Identifying the top 5 and bottom 5 best-selling pizza items

Creating an interactive Excel dashboard to visually represent trends and support data-driven decisions

## CONCLUSION-
The project successfully demonstrates how SQL and Excel can be combined for powerful business analytics. Through SQL-driven KPI extraction and Excel-based data visualization, clear patterns in sales behavior were identified. The final dashboard offers dynamic filtering, enabling users to explore product-level performance, customer preferences, and time-based trendsâ€”supporting better planning, inventory control, and promotional strategies in the pizza retail space.
